								<h2>Our Mission</h2>
								<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted the lives of people all around the world. Many people are unable to perform duties that are part of their daily lives. Senior citizens, people with compromised immune systems, and people with pre-existing medical conditions are at higher risk of contracting the virus and can put their health in jeopardy just by leaving their homes. So, at Door Drop, we aim to support those who are at a higher risk of being infected with COVID-19 by offering a free grocery delivery service. Customers will submit a form providing us with their grocery list, contact information, and address and will then receive their groceries at an agreed-upon pickup time with the delivery driver. To ensure the safety of our customers, our delivery driver has taken all safety precautions recommended by the CDC. There are many uncertainties during this time, so we strive to make people feel safe and comfortable. Thus, we will further aid the community by donating reusable masks to customers who utilize our service three times or more.
